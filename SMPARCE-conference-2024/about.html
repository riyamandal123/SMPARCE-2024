            <h2><br>The School of Civil Engineering</h2>
            <p><br> The School of Civil Engineering is headed by highly experienced Professor and is supported by well qualiﬁed faculty members. The school has state-of-the-art classrooms and well-equipped laboratories. It offers B.Tech in Civil Engineering and M.Tech programs in Computer Aided Structural Engineering, Transportation Engineering & Management and Construction Technology & Management, in addition to one-year certiﬁcation programmes in various streams.<br><br>
              The school also has research program leading to doctoral degree. The curriculum of both graduate and postgraduate degree programs have been designed to bridge the gap between industry – academia and hence they are industry application oriented. Civil Engineering teaching was limited to planning, analysis, design and execution of different types of infrastructure like buildings, roads, bridges, dams and power plants. However currently, due to increase of techno - logical sophistication

and demand for higher living standards geared up by economic growth and concerns about environ – mental impact have changed the scope of Civil Engineering. The REVA University would like to offer Civil Engineering Programme to produce quality engineers who are effective and efﬁcient in problem solving and providing economical and sustainable infrastructural solutions.
